This is the installing and usage introduction about Along32 library.
Lib Along32 is a function library of linux nasm, which is mainly moified from Irvine32 lib, the auxiliary library in "Assembly Language for Intel-based Computers", written by Kip R. Irvine.
Along32 lib is written by Curtis Wong, for the purpose of using the Irvine32 lib under Linux and learning the Intel-based assembly language.

This library can be used under Linux(x86) or other POSIX-compliant OS, but it has been only tested under Linux.
For the differences of design patterns between Linux and Windows, not all functions and macros in Irvine32 have been rewritten, but the core part of it.
Before you begin programing with Along32 lib, PLEASE read the comments in the Along32.inc to ensure the functions you want included in the library.

1. Install the library
It is very easy to install the Along32 lib. Completely installing can be chieved by only a few steps.
   a. cd src
      Change the current directory to src.
   b. make
      Build the library.
   c. make install
      Install the library to your Linux. The default location is /usr/lib.
      Normally, you should make sure that you own enough power to
      install the library to the location. Sudo it is the best solution.
   d. All is done!

2. How to use
After you install the library, you can use the functions and macros in it easily.
   a. Include the Along32.inc in your .asm source file.
      This step is the key to use the functions. Do not forget.
   b. Scan Along32.inc to find out the functions you want.
      And the usage of certain function is contained in src/Along32.asm,
      or you can read it in "Assembly Language for Intel-Based Computers,
      5th edition" in great details.
   c. Finish your assembly programing.
   d. Assembly your source file with NASM.
      Before assembling, make sure your nasm is correctly installed.
      Then type the following command:
      nasm -f elf -o objfile srcfile
      where objfile is the name of the object file normally suffixed by
      .o, and srcfile is your assembly source file.
   e. Link your object file into binary program with Along32 library.
      Type the following command:
      ld -lAlong32 --dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2 -o binfile objfile
      where binfile is the name of your final program, and objfile is the
      object file produced by last step.
   f. Enjoy your program and Along32 library.

===============================================================
Additionally, some macros have been created to simulate the psudo-instructions in MASM.
If you want to use these features, please read the comments in Macros_Along.inc for more information. To use these macros, just include the file and then build your program according to the above instructions.
